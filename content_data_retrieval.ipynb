      "of the (9,6) maser is unclear (Madden et al. 1986; Brown &\n",
      "Cragg 1991). Previous studies have suggested that there are three\n",
      "main pumping scenarios to explain the observed NH 3maser\n",

      "Comito et al. 2007; Beuther et al. 2018). This suggests that\n",
      "high kinetic temperatures are needed to excite NH 3(9,6) masers.\n",
      "However, it should be noted that the silicate dust absorption fea-\n",
      "ture might dominate at 10 \u0016m (see the spectral energy distribu-\n",

      "to explain the (9,6) masers in Cep A and G34.26 +0.15. Further-\n",
      "more, Wilson & Schilke (1993) argued that radiative pumping by\n",
